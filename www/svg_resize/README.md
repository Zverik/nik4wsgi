# SVG Resizer

Resizes SVG file to fit into given dimensions. For example, `--width 210 --margin 10`
would scale an image to 190 mm width with 10 mm margins. This is highly useful
for postprocessing autogenerated SVG files for converting to PDF, so paper
format is consistent with other pages. If two dimensions are specified
(e.g. `--longest 297 --shortest 210`), target scale is chosen so an image
fits into both of them (possibly leaving bigger margin). Default units are millimeters.

After resizing the script can add a white frame to hide parts of image that should not be shown:
use `--frame` option for that.
